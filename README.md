## Cloud-based sensor monitoring and alert management platform

### “Monitor” is a cloud-based sensor monitoring and alertmanagement platform which can be usedto centrally monitor any device regardless of itslocation. 
### The main functionality of the system isto alert on certain events based on the readings comingfrom the sensors.The system should be able to collect sensor data readingsfrom different sensors such asTemperature sensors, Humidity sensors, Pressure sensorsetc.
### Monitor system performs monitoring part only (Thealert generation and notifying the user whenthere is a device failure). 
### We should use the thirdparty sensor data providers such as Aretas,Imonnit and Helium which can send the sensor readingsto our system.
